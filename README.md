# Edge Detection with Roberts, Sobel, and Prewitt Operators

This notebook demonstrates the implementation of edge detection using Roberts, Sobel, and Prewitt operators on sample images. We will also compare the detected edges against manually marked expected edge locations and evaluate the results by adjusting the threshold values.

## Implemented Algorithms

1. Roberts Edge Detection
2. Sobel Edge Detection
3. Prewitt Edge Detection

## Requirements

- Python 3
- OpenCV
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

## Evaluation and Conclusion

To sum up, this project has improved my knowledge of several edge detection methods and highlighted the significance of parameter adjustment and manual verification in producing high-quality results. It emphasizes the iterative process of creating and optimizing computational techniques for image processing, emphasizing that although automatic techniques offer significant support, human supervision is still necessary for verification and advancement.
